                    Hello, my name is Gustavo Lopes, and I am a Computer Science student with a focus on back-end development using Python. I am currently expanding my knowledge in Java and applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in front-end projects. My passion for reading has been crucial in enhancing my programming skills, helping me to organize and detail my code in a way that facilitates its understanding and maintenance by other developers.
                    In my personal projects, I always strive to structure my code efficiently and clearly, which is reflected in both my back-end and front-end work. This commitment to best practices and attention to detail ensures the delivery of high-quality solutions tailored to the specific needs of each project. This meticulous approach is one of the pillars of excellence that I seek in my work.
